# rearc-quest-infra

Terraform and other related code required to deploy the rearc quest app.

## Rearc Quest app

This code is meant to deploy and run the [rearc quest](https://github.com/rearc/quest) web app.

## Usage

If you're starting from a fresh AWS account first thing is to install the AWS CLI. That is, after you've cloned this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwardtheharris/rearc-quest-infra
cd rearc-quest-infra
```

### AWS CLI

This can be done cleanly with pipenv. Assuming you don't have pipenv but do have a Python 3 version with pip installed. . .

```bash
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv shell 
pipenv install
```

### First TF run

There's no getting around the need to download the root user's access key id and secret key, so do that and use the AWS CLI to configure a profile named `root` . You will also need to generate a gpg key to prevent the created user's access key id and secret key being written in plaintext everywhere Terraform cares to write it. Make sure to select RSA as the key type when you generate the key.

```bash
export gpg_key_user=somegpgreference

aws configure --profile root
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --export ${gpg_key_user} | base64 > ${gpg_key_user}.gpg
```

Next configure the AWS profile to the root user, initialize the repository and apply the changes.

```bash
export TF_VAR_aws_profile=root

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -target aws_iam_access_key.admin
```

Now we've got a key id and secret key. We can decode the secret key with gpg then use it to configure the default aws profile. Finally, we unset the environment variable that tells terraform to use the root user instead of our IAM user.

```bash
terraform output -raw secret_access_key | base64 -D > /tmp/secret.gpg
gpg -d /tmp/secret.gpg
aws configure
unset TF_VAR_aws_profile
```

## Deploy an ec2 instance

The instance described in `ec2.tf` ought to do.

```bash
terraform apply -target aws_instance.rearc
```

When that's finished (don't forget to give the user data some time to run as well) you can log in to the AWS console to find the public IP, then hit the deployed in your brower at port 3000.

## Build a Docker image

First make a repository to store it in.

### ECR

ECR works well for this.

```bash
terraform apply -target aws_ecr_repository.rearc-quest
```

When this apply is done, you can log in to the AWS console to retrieve the ECR login command. You need to run this to push the application image to ECR. By now you'll have the secret word, which is [very clever](https://12factor.net/).

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 629354604262.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

### Docker build

Run the image build command. And push the image.

```bash
docker build -t 629354604262.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rearc/quest -f docker/Dockerfile docker/
docker push 629354604262.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rearc/quest
```

Next, deploy an ECS cluster with one node per AZ. We'll do the same with EKS in a bit, or maybe not.

### ECS Cluster

Use default because it's easier.
